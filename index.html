<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>
  I'm a PostDoc at the University of Geneva who studies topics in Geometric Group Theory and Formal Language Theory.
  For more details on my research topics, please see my <a href="{% link research.html %}">Research</a> page.
</p>

<p>
  I am an organiser for the <a href="https://researchseminars.org/seminar/SwissGAT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Switzerland Geometry, Algebra and Topology Seminar</a> in which we have bi-weekly talks from young researchers in Switzerland; I am also an organiser for the <em>World of GroupCraft conferences</em>, in particular, I was an organiser for
<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/world-of-ggt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GroupCraft I (2021)</a>,
<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/world-of-groupcraft-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GroupCraft II (2022)</a> and
<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/world-of-groupcraft-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GroupCraft III (2023)</a> (also, I plan on being an organiser for any future GroupCrafts).

<p>
  I manage the YouTube channels for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@worldofgroupcraft" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">World of GroupCraft</a> confererences, and for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SwissGAT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Switzerland Geometry, Algebra and Topology Seminar</a> (click the link to be taken to the channels).
  Please, consider subscribing to these YouTube channels if you're interested in the talks. (Almost all talks are uploaded to these channels shortly after they're recorded).
